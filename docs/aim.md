Aim of the project is as simple as this: A plugin framework with super modularity. I see big potential in here but I might be mistaken, who knows. Project can be summarized with following sentences.

In its core it will be plugin manager, the manager will handle the management of plugins simply, it will be the heart of the application. Most features if not all will be registered as plugins to the core. These plugins will abide by some interfaces so their interaction with both core and other plugins will be exact even at starting point.

At the first stage I am planning to create a basic todo application, later on this will turn into a extensible note vault, something like obsidian probably.

Other aim is creating a dependency index for concepts. This is a kinda complicated topic with its on gripes so it will be explained later on.
